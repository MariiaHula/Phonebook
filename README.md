This application is implemented for professional development. I'm using React
Hook Form from Yup to validate the form. Additionally, I use Redux Persist and
Redux Toolkit for state management. I implemented Single Page Applications
(SPAs) and handled asynchronous JavaScript loading for routing applications.
Additionally, I use React built-in hooks and have added styling experience with
Framer Motion, daisyUI, and TailwindCSS to my skill set.
